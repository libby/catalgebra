# Category theory is the algebra of functions

# A category A consists of a Set of Types and a set of functions (or morphism) 
# that connect the types

# Some properties of categories
# Every object has an identity function f: A => A
# Not all object have to be connect, i.e. take the identity category all objects only have arrows to themselves f: A => A, g: B => B
# Functions are compassable and composition is associative:
# f: A => B, g: B => C, h: C => D 
# h(g(f(a))) === h(g)(f(a))    (f * g) * h === f * (g * h)
